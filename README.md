# Controllable Conway

This program uses serial communication between an Arduino and [Processing](https://processing.org/) to interact with a sketch running Conway's Game of Life.

The Arduino sketch is located in the Arduino folder. The Processing sketch is located in the Processing folder and will require the [UiBooster](https://github.com/Milchreis/UiBooster) library by [Milchreis](https://github.com/Milchreis).

Credit to Joan Soler-Adillon for writing the original Processing implementation of Conway's Game of Life as seen [here](https://processing.org/examples/gameoflife.html).

Simple wiring diagram is present in the Diagram directory.
